# A-gui-chat-program

This program allows a server user to chat with client users. 
Clients can neither chat with each other nor send files to each other.
The communication and file transfer can be between server and clients.
The server user and client users can be on different networks.
But for this scenario, the server user needs to forward a port and computer's local ip address to the external ip address.
Then the clients can connect to the server via the external ip address of the server machine.
If the server and client users are on the same network, clients can connect via the local ip address of the server machine.
